**The magic circle is just an illustration for a better understanding of the problem. In a circular form n numbers are arranged, which are real numbers and are arranged in an ordered way.**

How it works? 🏆
---------------------  
**In the first step, as said before, the circle is represented by real and ordered numbers, from 1 to n, where n is the size of the circle. Already in the second step, there will be two numbers, represented by I and J. I and J are the numbers that will be used to make a cut in the circle, thus separating the same into two parts and we will call the left part and part right. The objective is to check the possible cuts where the right and left sides are equal by adding their elements.**
